    Command-line git.
    libgmp (http://gmplib.org/) is required by cvc3. Concolic testing 
	uses cvc3 and automaton.jar for constraint solving. The installation 
	script checks if cvc3 and automaton.jar are installed properly.
    Chrome browser if you need to test web apps.
    Python (http://python.org) version 2.7 or higher

On Windows you need the following extra dependencies:
