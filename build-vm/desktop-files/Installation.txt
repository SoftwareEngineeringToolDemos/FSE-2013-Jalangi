INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

On Ubuntu, you can install most of the requirements by running
this script, altered slightly from the official README.md:


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties python g++ make
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-7-oracle
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install libgmp10
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools


Be sure as well to download the repository from its home
on GitHub (https://github.com/SRA-SiliconValley/jalangi).

Once you have, navigate to that folder in a terminal on your 
machine and type the following:


python ./scripts/install.py


Most tests will pass. Some might fail because a file reference
to the author's original machine is hardcoded into a comparison
for a few tests' results. In these, you can typically compare
the results by looking at the tests' output.

For other OSs, you will need these dependencies, as written in
the official README.md:


    Latest version of Node.js available at http://nodejs.org/. 
	We have tested Jalangi with Node v0.10.25.
    Sun's JDK 1.6 or higher. We have tested Jalangi with Java 1.6.0_43.
    Command-line git.
    libgmp (http://gmplib.org/) is required by cvc3. Concolic testing 
	uses cvc3 and automaton.jar for constraint solving. The installation 
	script checks if cvc3 and automaton.jar are installed properly.
    Chrome browser if you need to test web apps.
    Python (http://python.org) version 2.7 or higher

On Windows you need the following extra dependencies:

    Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (Free express version is fine).
    If on 64bit also install Windows 7 64-bit SDK.
